# HART Operations & Commands

The straight forward mode of communication between HART master & slave devices rely on request & response basis. The master can both read from or write to the slave device & the slave device which is the field instrument, responses back with an appropriate reply.

[Fig.1: Read-Operation]

In read operation the Master device sends the command code to the slave device & The slave device responds with command code & data.
