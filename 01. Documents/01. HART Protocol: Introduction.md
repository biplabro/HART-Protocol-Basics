# HART Protocol: Introduction

The **HART** or `Highway Addressable Remote Transducer` Protocol is a 2-wire, current-loop communication link for instrumentation devices (pressure, flow, level, temperature transmitters etc.) [1] It's a digital (Frequency Shift Keying, FSK) communication system based on **BELL 202 modem technology** that is superimposed on 4-20mA analog signals for field devices.

The Industry 3.0 which is entirely dependant on various automation technology, relies on this protocol to communicate with the transducer infrastructure deployed over an industrial plant or manufacturing setup. A wide range of hardware vendors & manufacturers comply with this protocol & produce instruments at par with this technology. 

## Communication and Data

HART is built-in in most of the commercilly available measuring instruments, it allows to tranceive **both Analog & Digital data at the same time** over the same pair of communication lines.

Industrial sensors & other measurement devices used 4-20 mA analog current loop signal for communicating the value. HART is integrated with the analog signal in form of a frequency component of the transmitted analog signal. **The avarage value of the sinusoidal FSK signal is always 0, thus it does not degrade the accuracy & information of the actual analog current signal.**

### Data types:

A HART signal carries both digital & Analog data that includes:

**Analog**

- The measured value of the process variable
- 4mA stands for Lower Range Limit (LRL)
- 20mA stands for Upper Range Limit (URL)
- Analog value also represents the % value of the set thresholds

**Digital**

- Tag name
- Calibration settings
- Sensor diagnostics
