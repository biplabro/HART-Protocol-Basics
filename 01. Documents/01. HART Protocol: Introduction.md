# HART Protocol: Introduction

The **HART** or `Highway Addressable Remote Transducer` is a digital data communication protocol that is layered on top of a traditional 4-20mA analog signal which provides advanced data retreival & configuration options. 

It is a 2-wire, current-loop communication link for instrumentation devices (pressure, flow, level, temperature transmitters etc.) [1] It's a digital (Frequency Shift Keying, FSK) communication system based on **BELL 202 modem technology** that is superimposed on 4-20mA analog signals for field devices.

The Industry 3.0 which is entirely dependant on various automation technology, relies on this protocol to communicate with the transducer infrastructure deployed over an industrial plant or manufacturing setup. A wide range of hardware vendors & manufacturers comply with this protocol & produce instruments at par with this technology protocols.

## 1. How HART works

HART is built-in in most of the commercilly available measuring instruments, it allows to transmit **both Analog & Digital data at the same time** over the same pair of communication lines. Communication hardware available to turn a HART sensor into a Wireless transmitter. [4]

[Fig.3: HART Communication]

Industrial sensors & other measurement devices used 4-20 mA analog current loop signal for communicating the value. HART is integrated with the analog signal in form of a frequency component of the transmitted analog signal. **The avarage value of the sinusoidal FSK signal is always 0, thus it does not degrade the accuracy & information of the actual analog current signal.** For every oscillation (HART signal), the amplitude of the first half of each sine wave above the DC current curve is exactly equal to the amplitude of the second half of the sine wave below the DC current, leaving ZERO interference to the actual analog 4-20 mA current loop signal.

### 1.1 Information types:

A HART signal carries both digital & Analog information that includes:

**Analog**

- The measured value of the process variable
- 4mA stands for Lower Range Limit (LRL)
- 20mA stands for Upper Range Limit (URL)
- Analog value also represents the % value of the set thresholds
- Live Zero value (4mA) to ensure connectivity

**Digital**

- Tag name
- Calibration settings
- Sensor diagnostics

### 1.2 Topology

**1.2.1** The **Traditional HART** protocol consists of mainly two types of network topologies

- Point-to-point (one sensor per loop)
- Multi-drop (multiple sensors per loop)

Point-to-Point or single sensor per loop based topology is widely used across industrial plants. 

![Fig.4: HART Infrastructure (Point-to-Point)](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/Master-Slave.jpg)

[Fig.4: HART Infrastructure (Point-to-Point)]

In Traditional HART network, a multidrop topology can support upto a maximum of 63 nos. of connected sensors. **Each Individual node has a specific address** (node number) so that the sensors can be accessed remotely and directly. It is a **burst communication mode**, where only one slave device is used to broadcast a HART reply message.[2] 

![Fig.5: HART Infrastructure (Multi-Drop)](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/HART-Infrastructure.jpg)

[Fig.5: HART Infrastructure (Multi-Drop)]

Generally, multi-drop topology is used in smaller and resource limited applications. Burst mode enables faster communication (3â€“4 data updates per second). In burst mode, the master instructs the slave device to continuously broadcast a standard HART reply message (e.g., the value of the process variable). The master receives the message at the higher rate until it instructs the slave to stop bursting.[4]

**HART supports 2-master devices** in the topology, enabling greater flexibility by providing access to both Analog & Digital data for troubleshooting & diagnostics during ongoing plant operations.

The connections goes like this:

**Sensor<>(HART)<>PLC/RTU<>(Serial)<>User Application/Laptop**

Each HART device is capable of sending & receiving 30 to 50 different information. Including:

- Device tag name
- Process variable
- 4-20 mA analog reading
- Device status
- Diagnostic alerts
- Configuration parameters (LRL, URL)

[Fig.6: 5335 RTD internals] datasheet[5]

For example HART enabled Mass Flow Meters can transmit various parameters over a single pair of cable. Like:

- Volumetric Flow
- Mass Flow
- Density of Liquid
- Temperature etc.

**1.2.2** **Wireless HART** technology, on the other hand can consists of three topologies

![Fig.7: Wireless HART](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/Wireless-HART.jpg)

[Fig.7: Wireless HART]

- Star Network
- Mesh Network
- Combination of both

**HART allows device manufacturers to extend the diagnostic information** by adding custom Device Description (DD) files that enables the user to access & parse vendor specific information like

- Manufacturer ID
- Device model no.
- Firmware version
- Advanced diagnostic features
