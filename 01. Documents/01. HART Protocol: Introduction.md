# HART Protocol: Introduction

The **HART** or `Highway Addressable Remote Transducer` is a digital data communication protocol that is layered on top of a traditional 4-20mA analog signal which provides advanced data retreival & configuration options. 

It is a 2-wire, current-loop communication link for instrumentation devices (pressure, flow, level, temperature transmitters etc.) [1] It's a digital (Frequency Shift Keying, FSK) communication system based on **BELL 202 modem technology** that is superimposed on 4-20mA analog signals for field devices.

The Industry 3.0 which is entirely dependant on various automation technology, relies on this protocol to communicate with the transducer infrastructure deployed over an industrial plant or manufacturing setup. A wide range of hardware vendors & manufacturers comply with this protocol & produce instruments at par with this technology protocols.

## How HART works

HART is built-in in most of the commercilly available measuring instruments, it allows to transmit **both Analog & Digital data at the same time** over the same pair of communication lines. Communication hardware available to turn a HART sensor into a Wireless transmitter. [4]

Industrial sensors & other measurement devices used 4-20 mA analog current loop signal for communicating the value. HART is integrated with the analog signal in form of a frequency component of the transmitted analog signal. **The avarage value of the sinusoidal FSK signal is always 0, thus it does not degrade the accuracy & information of the actual analog current signal.**

### Information types:

A HART signal carries both digital & Analog information that includes:

**Analog**

- The measured value of the process variable
- 4mA stands for Lower Range Limit (LRL)
- 20mA stands for Upper Range Limit (URL)
- Analog value also represents the % value of the set thresholds
- Live Zero value (4mA) to ensure connectivity

**Digital**

- Tag name
- Calibration settings
- Sensor diagnostics

### Topology

The traditional HART protocol consists of mainly two types of network topologies

- Point-to-point (one sensor per loop)
- Multi-drop (multiple sensors per loop)

Wireless HART technology, on the other hand can consists of three topologies

- Star Network
- Mesh Network
- Combination of both

In traditional HART network, a multidrop topology can support upto a maximum of 63 nos. of connected sensors.
