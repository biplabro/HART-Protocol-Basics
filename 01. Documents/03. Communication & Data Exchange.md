# Communication & Data Exchange

[Fig.1: HART Modem Connection]

HART communication between a PC communicator and a pressure transmitter shown above[1]. When parameterizing with a PC, the connection is made through a HART modem. The signals needed for communication in conformity with the HART 5.x or 6.x protocols are superimposed on the output current using FSK (Frequency Shift Keying).

The protocol works on **request & response** basis. At any instance of time the master device can can **either read from, or write to slave devices**. 

## 1. Network Layers

The HART protocol follows the seven-layer OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) protocol, although it uses only three layers: application, data link, and physical. The other four are not used, which is so for most of the field level protocols such as HART. The HART and the OSI protocol layers are shown in Table[2].

|OSI Layers|HART Layers|

|Application|HART Commands|

|Data Link|HART Protocol Rules|
|Physical|BELL 202|

### 1.1 Physical Layer

HART uses an FSK physical layer that is based on the Bell 202 modem standard. It modulates digital “1” into 1200 Hz and “0” into 2200 Hz. This kind of modulation is robust and has very good noise immunity. A HART modem chip is used at both the sending and receiving ends for modulation and demodulation, respectively.

[Fig.1: HART Frequency Bands]

HART devices support both the conventional 4–20 mA current signal and modulated HART communications. These occupy different communication bands. Because of their noninterfering nature, both communications are possible simultaneously. The HART communication signal is filtered out by the analog devices and as such they remain unaffected by the HART signal. Thus, devices with 4–20 mA input or output work nicely in control loops.
