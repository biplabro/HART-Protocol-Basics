# Device configurations & FAQ

HART enabled instrumentation devices can work with both vendor specific **propietary DD (Device Description) files** and **OpenFramework based DTM (Device Type Manager) files**[1]. 

Due to the versatility in device manufacturers specifications & in order to attain a generalized communication & data acquisition requirements FDT (Field Device Tool) group was formed. 

* FDT Joint Interest Group formed in 2003 by ABB, E+H, Invensys, Metso Automation and Siemens.
* Open – Independent – not for profit organisation.
* Collaboration of international companies dedicated to establish an international standard based on Field Device Tool technology.
* FDT Group founded in 2005 according to Belgian law as a legally independent organisation.

**DTM specifications are standardised by the FDT group**. The Basic HART component is a device type manager (DTM), and only operates within a field device tool (FDT) environment. The application can be called by means of the function blocks listed below: [2]

- Configuration
- Parameterisation
- Diagnostics
- Display of measurements
- Simulation

## 1. FAQs

### What is PACTware?
PACTware is a multi-manufacturer supported and fieldbus-independent software application for easy operation of automation field devices. The stand-alone PACTware tool can be used to configure, operate, and diagnose all devices in a plant. The software is freely available to the user and is the most widely used FDT frame application[4].

PACTware 5.0 is open source to the members of the PACTware Consortium[5]. Thus allowing multiple vendors & developers to use the software & integrate with their core applications & hardware. It supports a wide number of protocols including HART, IO-Link, FieldBus and many more. 

###  What is the FDT Technology? 
FDT Technology standardizes the communication interface between field devices and control systems or engineering and asset management tools. Key features are its independence from the communication protocol and the software environment of either the device or the host system. FDT Technology allows any device to be accessed from any host through any protocol.

###  What is the FDT Interface? 
The FDT interface specification describes the standardized data exchange between devices and control systems or engineering and asset management tools. Devices can be configured, operated, and maintained through the standardized user interfaces integrated in an FDT Frame Application.
