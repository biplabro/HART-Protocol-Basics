# Device configurations & FAQ

HART enabled instrumentation devices can work with both vendor specific **propietary DD (Device Description) files** and **OpenFramework based DTM (Device Type Manager) files**[1]. 

Due to the versatility in device manufacturers specifications & in order to attain a generalized communication & data acquisition requirements FDT (Field Device Tool) group was formed. 

* FDT Joint Interest Group formed in 2003 by ABB, E+H, Invensys, Metso Automation and Siemens.
* Open – Independent – not for profit organisation.
* Collaboration of international companies dedicated to establish an international standard based on Field Device Tool technology.
* FDT Group founded in 2005 according to Belgian law as a legally independent organisation.

**DTM specifications are standardised by the FDT group**. The Basic HART component is a device type manager (DTM), and only operates within a field device tool (FDT) environment. The application can be called by means of the function blocks listed below: [2]

- Configuration
- Parameterisation
- Diagnostics
- Display of measurements
- Simulation

## 1. FAQs

### What is PACTware?
PACTware is a multi-manufacturer supported and fieldbus-independent software application for easy operation of automation field devices. The stand-alone PACTware tool can be used to configure, operate, and diagnose all devices in a plant. The software is freely available to the user and is the most widely used FDT frame application[4].

**PACTware 5.0 is open source to the members of the PACTware Consortium**[5]. Thus allowing multiple vendors & developers to use the software & integrate with their core applications & hardware. It supports a wide number of protocols including HART, IO-Link, FieldBus and many more. 

###  What is the FDT Technology? 
FDT Technology standardizes the communication interface between field devices and control systems or engineering and asset management tools. Key features are its independence from the communication protocol and the software environment of either the device or the host system. FDT Technology allows any device to be accessed from any host through any protocol.

###  What is the FDT Interface? 
The FDT interface specification describes the standardized data exchange between devices and control systems or engineering and asset management tools. Devices can be configured, operated, and maintained through the standardized user interfaces integrated in an FDT Frame Application.

###  What is a Device Type Manager (DTM)? 
A Device Type Manager (DTM) is part of the FDT standard that is a software component for a device that contains the device-specific data, functions and logic elements. DTMs can reach from a simple graphical user interface for setting device parameters upto a highly sophisticated application that, for example, can perform complex calculations for diagnostics and maintenance purposes or can implement arbitrarily complex business logics for device calibration.

The DTM also contains FDT-compliant interfaces to enable communication with the connected system or tool. DTMs are classified as Device DTMs, which represent a field device, and CommDTMs, which represent communication components (gateways, remote I/Os, couplers, etc.).

A typical FDT based application can contain dozens, hundreds, or thousands of Device DTMs and CommDTMS from a variety of manufacturers to make up the system.

###  Which communication protocols does FDT Technology support? 
The FDT specification supports the communication protocols:
* AS-interface
* CANopen
* CIP Annex Configuration
* ControlNet
* DeviceNet
* EtherNet/IP
* FOUNDATION Fieldbus
* HART
* INTERBUS
* IO Link
* MODBUS SL/TCP
* PROFIBUS DP/PA, and 
* PROFINET I/O

The FDT Group is open to future developments and market requirements and continues to expand its support of new protocols.

Due to the open nature of the standard, several device and host manufacturers have even added their own proprietary or legacy protocols to the standard for use in their own applications.

### What is a (DD) Device Description?
Key to the HART Protocol's ability to "get data out of the field device" is a data file called a Device Description (DD). This describes the features and functions of a device, such as the form and content of menus and graphic displays to be presented in host computers or handheld devices. The DD is written in conformance with a Device Description Language in the protocol. The HART Communication Foundation manages a library of Manufacturer Device Descriptions, and provides regular updates to which any Foundation member can subscribe. DD’s are available for download at the HART Communication Foundation website and device manufacturer's website as well. The DD is not required for communication with HART-enabled devices. It is an optional enabling element of HART technology that most device and host suppliers support in order to offer HART Users the added value of multi-vendor interoperability

### Can PACTware use DDs instead of DTMs?
PACTware does not support DDs directly, but there are several software tools available on the market which convert DDs into DTMs to be used in FDT frames like PACTware.

### Is the Generic HART DTM contained in the instrument or are the definitions located somewhere else?
The Generic DTM supports the HART commands which are common to all HART instruments (Universal and Common Practice commands). A typical instrument will contain device specific commands that will require a more device specific DTM for full support.
