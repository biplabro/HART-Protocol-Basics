[Fig.1: HART Modem Connection]

HART communication between a PC communicator and a pressure transmitter shown above[1]. When parameterizing with a PC, the connection is made through a HART modem. The signals needed for communication in conformity with the HART 5.x or 6.x protocols are superimposed on the output current using FSK (Frequency Shift Keying).

The protocol works on **request & response** basis
