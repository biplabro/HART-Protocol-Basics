# Device configurations & Keywords

HART enabled instrumentation devices can work with both vendor specific **propietary DD (Device Description) files** and **OpenFramework based DTM (Device Type Manager) files**[1]. 

Due to the versatility in device manufacturers specifications & in order to attain a generalized communication & data acquisition requirements FDT (Field Device Tool) group was formed. 

* FDT Joint Interest Group formed in 2003 by ABB, E+H, Invensys, Metso Automation and Siemens.
* Open – Independent – not for profit organisation.
* Collaboration of international companies dedicated to establish an international standard based on Field Device Tool technology.
* FDT Group founded in 2005 according to Belgian law as a legally independent organisation.

DTM specifications are standardised by the FDT group. The Basic HART component is a device type manager (DTM), and only operates within a field device tool environment. The application can be called by means of the function blocks listed below: [2]

- Configuration
- Parameterisation
- Diagnostics
- Display of measurements
- Simulation
