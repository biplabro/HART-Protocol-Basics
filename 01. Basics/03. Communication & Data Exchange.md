# Communication & Data Exchange

[Fig.1: HART Modem Connection]

HART communication between a PC communicator and a pressure transmitter shown above[1]. When parameterizing with a PC, the connection is made through a HART modem. The signals needed for communication in conformity with the HART 5.x or 6.x protocols are superimposed on the output current using FSK (Frequency Shift Keying).

The protocol works on **request & response** basis. At any instance of time the master device can can **either read from, or write to slave devices**. 

## 1. Network Layers

The HART protocol follows the seven-layer OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) protocol, although it uses only three layers: application, data link, and physical. The other four are not used, which is so for most of the field level protocols such as HART. The HART and the OSI protocol layers are shown in Table[2].

|OSI Layers|HART Layers|
|----------|-----------|
|Application|HART Commands|
|Presentation||
|Session||
|Transport||
|Network||
|Data Link|HART Protocol Rules|
|Physical|BELL 202|

### 1.1 Physical Layer (BELL 202)

HART uses an FSK physical layer that is based on the Bell 202 modem standard. It modulates digital “1” into 1200 Hz and “0” into 2200 Hz. This kind of modulation is robust and has very good noise immunity. A HART modem chip is used at both the sending and receiving ends for modulation and demodulation, respectively.

[Fig.3: HART Frequency Bands]

HART devices support both the conventional 4–20 mA current signal and modulated HART communications. These occupy different communication bands. Because of their noninterfering nature, both communications are possible simultaneously. The HART communication signal is filtered out by the analog devices and as such they remain unaffected by the HART signal. Thus, devices with 4–20 mA input or output work nicely in control loops.

### 1.2 Data Link Layer (HART Protocol FRAME)

The HART message frame format, often called a HART telegram, **consists of nine fields**. The structure of the FSK HART message is shown below[4]:

![Fig.4: HART Frame](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/HART-Frame.jpg)

[Fig.4: HART Frame]

1) The **preamble**, of between 5 and 20 bytes of hex FF (all 1’s), helps the receiver to synchronise to the character stream.

2) The **start** character may have one of several values, indicating the type of message: master to slave, slave to master, or burst message from slave; also the address format: short frame or long frame. Since HART rev. 6, it also indicates the number of bytes in the “expansion” field (see below).

3) The **address** field includes both the master address (a single bit: 1 for a primary master, 0 for a secondary master) and the slave address. In the short frame format, the slave address is 4 bits containing the “polling address” (0 to 15). In the long frame format, it is 38 bits containing a “unique identifier” for that particular device. (One bit is also used to indicate if a slave is in burst mode.)

4) The **expansion** field allows for up to 3 additional bytes to be inserted between the address and command fields. The number of bytes present will be indicated by bits 6 and 5 in the start delimiter. Use of this feature, introduced in HART rev. 6, is as yet undefined.

5) The **command** byte contains the HART command for this message. Universal commands are in the range 0 to 30; common practice commands are in the range 32 to 126; device-specific commands are in the range 128 to 253. HART rev. 6 introduced 16-bit “extended commands” for device family commands. These put 31 (hex 1f) in this byte, and the 2-byte command number as the first 2 bytes in the “data” field.

6) The **byte count** byte contains the number of bytes to follow in the status and data bytes. The receiver uses this to know when the message is complete. (There is no special “end of message” character.)

7) The **status** field (also known as the “response code”) is two bytes, only present in the response message from a slave. It contains information about communication errors in the outgoing message, the status of the received command, and the status of the device itself.

8) The **data** field may or may not be present, depending on the particular command. Universal and common-practice commands use up to 33 bytes of data, keeping the overall message duration reasonable. (But some devices have device-specific commands using longer data fields.) See also the HART data field.

9) Finally, the **checksum** byte contains an “exclusive-or” or “longitudinal parity” of all previous bytes (from the start character onwards). Together with the parity bit attached to each byte, this is used to detect communication errors.

### 1.3 Application Layer (HART Commands)

HART commands are defined in the application layer of the HART protocol. The communication routines of the HART master devices and the programs are based on these commands. Commands from the master can seek for data, start-up service, or diagnostic information. The slave, in turn, responds by sending back the required informations to the master[2].

The HART command set includes three types of commands: 
- Universal commands
- Common practice commands, and
- Device-specific commands. 

The host application may implement any of the command types for a particular application. A partial list of different types of HART commands is shown in Below Table.

|Universal commands|Common practice commands|Device-specific commands|
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
|Read Manufacturer & device type|Read selection of upto 4 variables|Read or write low flow cut-off|
|Read Primary Variable(PV) & units|Write damping time constant|Start, Stop or Clear totalizer|
|Read current output & percent of range|Write device range values|Read or write density calibration factor|
|Read upto 4 predefined primary variables|Calibrate (set zero, set span)|Choose PV (mass, flow, density etc.)|
|Read or write 8-char tag, 16-char descriptor, date|Set fixed output current|Read or write material or construction information|
|Read or write 32-char message|Perform self-test|Trim sensor calibration|
|Read device range, values, units & damping time constant|Perform master reset|PID enable|
|Read or write final assembly number|Trim PV zero|Write PID setpoint|
|Write polling address|Write PV unit|Valve characterization|
