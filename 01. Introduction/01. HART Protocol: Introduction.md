# HART Protocol: Introduction

The **HART** or `Highway Addressable Remote Transducer` is a digital data communication protocol that is layered on top of a traditional 4-20mA analog signal which provides advanced data retreival & configuration options. 

It is a 2-wire, current-loop communication link for instrumentation devices (pressure, flow, level, temperature transmitters etc.) [1] It's a digital (Frequency Shift Keying, FSK) communication system based on **BELL 202 modem technology** that is superimposed on 4-20mA analog signals for field devices.

The Industry 3.0 which is entirely dependant on various automation technology, relies on this protocol to communicate with the transducer infrastructure deployed over an industrial plant or manufacturing setup. A wide range of hardware vendors & manufacturers comply with this protocol & produce instruments at par with this technology protocols.

## 1. How HART works

HART is built-in in most of the commercilly available measuring instruments, it allows to transmit **both Analog & Digital data at the same time** over the same pair of communication lines. Communication hardware available to turn a HART sensor into a Wireless transmitter. [4]

![Fig.3: HART Communication](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/HART-Comm.jpg)

[Fig.3: HART Communication]

Industrial sensors & other measurement devices used 4-20 mA analog current loop signal for communicating the value. HART is integrated with the analog signal in form of a frequency component of the transmitted analog signal. **The avarage value of the sinusoidal FSK signal is always 0, thus it does not degrade the accuracy & information of the actual analog current signal.** For every oscillation (HART signal), the amplitude **(+0.5 mA)** of the first half [8] of each sine wave above the DC current curve is exactly equal to the amplitude **(-0.5 mA)** of the second half of the sine wave below the DC current, leaving ZERO interference to the actual analog 4-20 mA current loop signal. Each digital signal 0 and 1 are in continuous phase to comply with the compensation technique.

### 1.1 Information types:

A HART signal carries both digital & Analog information that includes:

**Analog**

- The measured value of the process variable
- 4mA stands for Lower Range Limit (LRL)
- 20mA stands for Upper Range Limit (URL)
- Analog value also represents the % value of the set thresholds
- Live Zero value (4mA) to ensure connectivity

**Digital**

- Tag name
- Calibration settings
- Sensor diagnostics

### 1.2 Topology

**1.2.1** The **Traditional HART** protocol consists of mainly two types of network topologies

- Point-to-point (one sensor per loop)
- Multi-drop (multiple sensors per loop)

Point-to-Point or single sensor per loop based topology is widely used across industrial plants. 

![Fig.4: HART Infrastructure (Point-to-Point)](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/Master-Slave.jpg)

[Fig.4: HART Infrastructure (Point-to-Point)]

In Traditional HART network, a multidrop topology can support upto a maximum of 63 nos. of connected sensors. **Each Individual node has a specific address** (node number) so that the sensors can be accessed remotely and directly. 

![Fig.5: HART Infrastructure (Multi-Drop)](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/HART-Infrastructure.jpg)

[Fig.5: HART Infrastructure (Multi-Drop)]

Generally, multi-drop topology is used in smaller and resource limited applications. In this topology, the DC current amplitude is fixed (at 4mA, generally) and all the HART enabled sensors communicate over the same loop interface in digital mode.

**HART supports 2-master devices** in the topology, enabling greater flexibility by providing access to both Analog & Digital data for troubleshooting & diagnostics during ongoing plant operations. **Primart master** is the RTU/ PLC or similar devices & the **Secondary master** is Handheld or Field communicator devices.

The connections goes like this:

**Sensor<>(HART)<>PLC/RTU<>(Serial)<>User Application/Laptop**

Each HART device is capable of sending & receiving 30 to 50 different information. Including:

- Device tag name
- Process variable
- 4-20 mA analog reading
- Device status
- Diagnostic alerts
- Configuration parameters (LRL, URL)

[Fig.6: 5335 RTD internals] datasheet[5]

For example HART enabled Mass Flow Meters can transmit various parameters over a single pair of cable. Like:

- Volumetric Flow
- Mass Flow
- Density of Liquid
- Temperature etc.

**1.2.2** **Wireless HART** technology, on the other hand can consists of three topologies

- Star Network
- Mesh Network
- Combination of both

The network uses IEEE 802.15.4 compatible radios operating in the 2.4GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical radio band. The radios employ direct-sequence spread spectrum technology and channel hopping for communication security and reliability, as well as TDMA synchronized, latency-controlled communications between devices on the network. This technology has been proven in field trials and real plant installations across a broad range of process control industries [13].

![Fig.7: Wireless HART](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/Wireless-HART.jpg)

[Fig.7: Wireless HART]

**Each device in the mesh network can serve as a router for messages from other devices. In other words, a device doesn’t have to communicate directly to a gateway, but just forward its message to the next closest device.** This extends the range of the network and provides redundant communication routes to increase reliability.

**HART allows device manufacturers to extend the diagnostic information** by adding custom Device Description (DD) files that enables the user to access & parse vendor specific information like

- Manufacturer ID
- Device model no.
- Firmware version
- Advanced diagnostic features 

### 1.3 Built-in PID algorithms

HART transmitters can consist of built-in PID algorithms. For example, A PID slave device can give feedback to the control loop in order to alter the position of a control valve.

![Fig.8: PID-Operation](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/HART-PID-Control%20loop.jpg)

[Fig.8: PID-Operation]

**` alteration in valve position (Feedback) = (set value - measured value) `**
If the measured value of the process variable is higher than the set value, the system will produce a negative feedback & if the measured value is lower, positive feedback will be sent to the control system.

## 2. Generating HART signals

At the core of the HART signal generator, Op-Amp based adder circuits[9] are used where the sinusoidal AC signal is added over the standard 4-20 mA dc signal. A hart modem can be interfaced [10] to communicate with the devices.

![Fig.9: HART interface](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/HART%20interface.jpg)

[Fig.9: HART interface]

## 3. Communication Modes

HART enabled devices can work in two communication modes **i) Master-Slave mode** and **ii) Burst mode**

### 3.1 Master-Slave Mode

In this mode, the communication happens as **Request & Response** basis [11]. It means that during normal operation, each slave (field device) communication is initiated by a master communication device.

![Fig.10: Master-Slave Mode](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/Master-Slave%20mode.jpg)

[Fig.10: Master-Slave Mode]

- Master (PLC/ DCS/ RTU/ Handheld communicator etc.)
- Slave (Transmitter, Actuator, Control valve etc.)

### 3.2 Burst Mode

This mode enables faster communication (3–4 data updates per second). In burst mode, the master instructs the slave device to continuously broadcast a standard HART reply message with a time interval[12] (e.g., the value of the process variable). The master receives the message at the higher rate until it instructs the slave to stop bursting.[4]. It is a **burst communication mode**, where only one slave device is used to broadcast a HART reply message.[2] 

![Fig.11: Burst Mode](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/Burst%20mode.jpg)

[Fig.11: Burst Mode]

## 4. Communicating via HART

A hart modem or Loop interface communicator can be placed in the communication loop to interact with the sesing devices.
