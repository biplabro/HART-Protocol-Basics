# Simulation using Software Tools

For simulation, The virtual master & slave devices neet to talk to each other using a serial connection[1]. Here, the 2 serial ports acts like a null modem[2].

[Fig.1: Simulation Environment]

### 1. Simulation tools:

All these softwares are propietary  & shareware that comes with a time-limited usage period.

[Fig.2: Simulation Tools]

1. **Master/ Slave simulator:**  [HART Tools 7.5](https://www.borst-automation.de/download/) [3]
2. **Serial port (null modem):** [Virtual Serial Port Kit](https://www.fabulatech.com/virtual-serial-port-kit.html) [4]

### 2. Simulation Results:

The simulated slave has 4 variables to measure

![Fig.3: Simulation Slave](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Internals/blob/main/02.%20Images/Simulation-Slave.jpg)

[Fig.3: Simulation Slave]

- Flow **(l/m)**
- Pressure **(mBar)**
- Level **(mm)**
- Temperature **(^C)**

Simulated master sends various commands & the slave responds accordingly.

#### 2.1 Read Operation 

![Fig.4: HART Command-2](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Internals/blob/main/02.%20Images/Command-2.jpg)

[Fig.4: HART Command-2]

Master sends command-2 (Read current and % of range) to slave. Response is shown below

[Fig.4: HART Command-3]

Master sends command-3 (Read current & 4 dynamic variables) to slave. Response is shown below

![Fig.5: Simulation Command-3](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Internals/blob/main/02.%20Images/Simulation_Hexadecimal.jpg)

[Fig.5: Simulation Command-3]

In this simulation, Command 3 outputs the HART specified expected Slave response format. **`26`** (decimal) is the byte count (2 bytes Status + 24 bytes data), **checksum byte is not included in byte count**. HART Tools 7.5 has a buil-in decoder that formats the HEX data & units into text format.

#### 2.2 Write Operation

![Fig.7: HART Command-6](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Internals/blob/main/02.%20Images/Command-6.jpg)

[Fig.7: HART Command-6]

Master sends command-6 (Write polling address) with the desired `polling addres number` (04) as data in the request command to the slave device. Slave device then echoes the same command & Pollin ID to the Master once the changes are made in the slave hardware.

**Please create an issue or pull request with information regarding any Opensource (preferably Linux supported) alternative of HART tools 7.5, & the repo will be updated.**
