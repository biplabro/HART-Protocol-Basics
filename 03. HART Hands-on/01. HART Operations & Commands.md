# HART Operations & Commands

The straight forward mode of communication between HART master & slave devices rely on request & response basis. The master can both read from or write to the slave device & the slave device which is the field instrument, responses back with an appropriate reply.

## 1. Read-Write Operations

**Read Operation**

![Fig.1: Read-Operation](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/HART_Read.jpg)

[Fig.1: Read-Operation]

In read operation, the Master device sends the **command code** to the slave device & The slave device replies with **command code response & data**.

**Write Operation**

[Fig.2: Write-Operation]

In write operation, the Master device sends the **command code & data** to be written to the slave device & The slave device replies with **command code response**.

## 2. Interpretation of commands

Here we will discuss some **Universal & Common practice commands**, Reference Documents[1], [2]. **Command codes are in Decimal**.
