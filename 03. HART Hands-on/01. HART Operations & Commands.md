# HART Operations & Commands

The straight forward mode of communication between HART master & slave devices rely on request & response basis. **The master can both read from or write to the slave device & the slave device which is the field instrument, responses back with an appropriate reply**.

- As per the HART specifications **`command-0 to command-32`** represents **universal commands**

## 1. Read-Write Operations

**Read Operation:**

![Fig.2: Read-Operation](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/HART_Read.jpg)

[Fig.2: Read-Operation]

In read operation, the Master device sends the **command code** to the slave device & The slave device replies with **command code response & data**.

**Write Operation:**

![Fig.3: Write-Operation](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Basics/blob/main/02.%20Images/HART_Write.jpg)

[Fig.3: Write-Operation]

In write operation, the Master device sends the **command code & data** to be written to the slave device & The slave device replies with **command code response**.

## 2. Interpretation of commands

Here we will discuss some **Universal & Common practice commands**, Reference Documents[1], [2]. **Command codes are in Decimal** for convenience. In the communication, the commands & response are in **Hexadecimal format** & even down the line, in low level hardware the actual communication happens in Binary system. The table is formatted as `Commands > Details of the commands > Details of the reply`

### 2.1 Read Commands

#### Command-0: `(Read Unique identifier)`

![Fig.4: Read Unique identifier](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Internals/blob/main/02.%20Images/Command-0.jpg)

[Fig.4: Read Unique identifier]

Command: `0 (1 byte)`

Data in command: `None (since no data needs to be specified)`

Data in Reply:

`The mentioned response is 12 bytes long with each byte having its own classification.`

- 0th (First Byte) - static to 254 (FE)
- 1st byte - Manufacturer ID 
- 2nd byte - Device type ID
- 3rd byte - Number of required preambles
- 4th byte - Universal command revision number
- 5th byte - Device specific command revision number
- 6th byte - Software revision number
- 7th byte - Hardware revision number
- 8th byte - Device function flags (features)
- 9-11 byte - Device ID

#### Command-1: `(Read Primary Variable, PV)`

![Fig.5: Read Primary Variable](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Internals/blob/main/02.%20Images/Command-1.jpg)

[Fig.5: Read Primary Variable]

All HART compatible Field Devices are required to return the Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary Variables. These are collectively called the Dynamic Variables. In addition, all HART compatible Field Devices contain Device Variables. Simple Field Devices may use only Dynamic Variables and not expose the underlying Device Variables at the Protocol Application Layer interface. In simple devices the mapping of Device Variables to Dynamic Variables is fixed. More sophisticated devices allow this mapping to be configured[2].

[Fig.6: Device Variables]

#### Command-2: `(Read current & Percent of range)`

![Fig.7: Read current & Percent of range](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Internals/blob/main/02.%20Images/Command-2.jpg)

[Fig.7: Read current & Percent of range]

- Here the **`(F)`** specifies the data type which is `Floating point value`.

#### Command-3: `(Read current & Four dynamic variables)`

![Fig.8: Read current & 4 dynamic variables](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Internals/blob/main/02.%20Images/Command-3.jpg)

[Fig.8: Read current & 4 dynamic variables]

Each response byte has its own interpretation. 
- All the variables (Primary, First, Second, Third, Fourth) are in floating point values **(F)**.
- the unit code represents **mA, cm3/s, g/cm3 etc**.

### 2.2 Write Commands

- In a successful write operation response the `Byte Count` byte always represents a **positive integer**.

#### Command-18: `(Write Tag, Descriptor, Date)`

![Fig.9: Write  Tag, Descriptor, Date](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Internals/blob/main/02.%20Images/Command-18.jpg)

[Fig.9: Write  Tag, Descriptor, Date]

**Master:** The write command frame includes the data to be written on the device. 
- With the above command, device tag, descriptor & date can be written into the Device (EEPROM,SoC)
- Data type **`A`** means the HEX represents **Alphabets** (Characters) 
- Data type **`D`** means the HEX represents **Numbers** (Decimals) 

 **Slave:** The response data is "As in Command", which means the **slave device will echo the input data to the master once the changes are made into the slave device**. 

#### Command-35: `(Write Range values)`

This is a **Common Practice Command** & may or may not be applicable to all HART compliant devices.
