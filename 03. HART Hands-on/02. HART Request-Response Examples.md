### Example 1: `(Command-0)`

This is a **Universal command** & should be supported by all HART devices. 

Master will send `command 0` to slave and read the response data. All the bytes sections are color coded. In the above picture, **`m`** stands for master command frame **(Request)**, **`s`** stand for slave command frame **(Response)**. 

**Master Request:**
- **`03 32 36 02`** includes the **Slave address** with which the master wants to communicate with.
- **`0`** marked in RED is the command code which in this case is the **`Read Unique Identifier`**
- **`Byte Count`** is **0** in master request packet since no data is sent along with the command.

**Slave Response**

- **`Address`** and **`command`** bytes are reflected (echo) as in the master request.
- **`Byte count`** is **`0x0E`** which represents that the **total number of bytes in `Status (2-bytes) + DATA` is 14**.

[Fig.2: Command 0 (Request & Response)]

  **Data bytes Interpretation:**
  
- **`FE`** represents `byte 0` which is static 254 by command specification.
- **`13`** represents `byte 1` which is the manufacturer ID.
- **`03`** represents `byte 2` which is manufacturer device type ID.
- **`05`** represents `byte 3` which is the number of preambles.
- **`05`** represents `byte 4` which is Universal HART command revision 5.
- **`01`** represents `byte 5` which is Device specific HART command revision number.
- **`05`** represents `byte 6` which is the software revision number.
- **`08`** represents `byte 7` which is the hardware revision number.
- **`00`** represents `byte 8` which is Device function flags, .
- **`32 36 02`** represents `bytes 9 to 11` which is the device ID of the slave.

### Example 2: `(Command-3)`

This is a **Universal command** & should be supported by all HART devices. 

Unit Codes of variables like temp., pressure, current etc. is specified by the HART foundation & are universal for all HART compliant devices. For example, **`0x27`** unit code represents current in **mA**

**Master Request:**
- **`03 32 36 02`** includes the **Slave address** with which the master wants to communicate with.
- **`3`** marked in RED is the command code which in this case is the **`Read current & 4 variables`**
- **`Byte Count`** is **0** in master request packet since no data is sent along with the command.

**Slave Response**

- **`Address`** and **`command`** bytes are reflected (echo) as in the master request.
- **`Byte count`** is **`0x1A`** which represents that the **total number of bytes in `Status (2-bytes) + DATA` is 26**.

![Fig.3: Command 3 (Read current & 4 variables)](https://github.com/biplabro/HART-Protocol-Internals/blob/main/02.%20Images/Example_Command-3.jpg)

[Fig.3: Command 3 (Read current & 4 variables)]

  **Data bytes Interpretation:**
  
- **`40 80 60 00`** represents `byte 0-3` which is the current (mA) measurement value in Floating point.
- **`27`** represents `byte 4` which is the unit (mA) of primary variable (PV), in this case, current.
- **`40 80 60 00`** represents `byte 5-8` which is redundant & indicates the value of the **Primary Variable** (PV).
- **`39`** represents `byte 9` which is **unit code (psi, bar, cm3/s etc)** of Secondary Variable. (SV)
- **`C1 B7 E0 00`** represents `byte 10-13` which is the value of the **Secondary Variable** (SV).
- **`06`** represents `byte 14` which is unit (psi, bar, cm3/s etc) of Tertiary Variable (TV).
- **`C2 DC 80 00`** represents `byte 15-18` which is the value of the **Tertiary Variable** (TV).
- **`39`** represents `byte 19` which is unit (psi, bar, cm3/s etc) of Quarternary Variable (QV).
- **`BD 7A 00 00`** represents `byte 5-8` which is the value of the **Quarternary Variable** (QV).

### Example 3: `(Command-33)`

This is a **Common Practice command** & may or may not be supported by all HART devices. 

In this command, the master has to specify the **Transmitter variable (temp, pressure, flow etc.) code** for each individual slots of the measuring instrument (Assuming that the HART transmitter can sense upto 4 different parameters). **Unit code represents mA, K, psi, bar, cm3/s etc**.

**Master Request:**
- **`03 32 36 02`** includes the **Slave address** with which the master wants to communicate with.
- **`33`** marked in RED is the command code which in this case is the **`Read transmitter variables`**
- **`Byte Count`** is **4** in master request packet since 4 variable codes to be specified.
- **`0C 00 00 00`** are the variable codes mentioned in byte count

**Slave Response**

- **`Address`** and **`command`** bytes are reflected (echo) as in the master request.
- **`Byte count`** is **`0x1A`** which represents that the **total number of bytes in `Status (2-bytes) + DATA` is 26**.

[Fig.4: Command 33 (Read transmitter variables)]

  **Data bytes Interpretation:**
  
- **`0C`** represents `byte 0` which is the transmitter variable code for slot-0.
- **`00`** represents `byte 1` which is the unit code for slot-0.
- **`00 00 00 03`** represents `byte 2-5` which is the value of the slot-0 variable in floating point **`F`**.

- **`27`** represents `byte 19` which is the unit code for slot-3.
- **`40 80 60 00`** represents `byte 20-23` which is the value of the slot-3 variable in floating point **`F`**.

### Example 4: `(Command-48)`

This is a **Common Practice command** & may or may not be supported by all HART devices.

This command is used to read additional device statuses. The **`Device Status`** and **`Operational Modes`** codes are pre-defined by the HART protocol. 

**Master Request:**
- **`13`** is a part of the Start Delimiter (SD) byte; Master to Slave.
- **`03 32 36 02`** includes the **Slave address** with which the master wants to communicate with.
- **`48`** marked in RED is the command code which in this case is the **`Read Additional Device Status`**
- **`Byte Count`** is **0** in master request packet since no data is sent along with the command.

**Slave Response**

- **`53`** is a part of the Start Delimiter (SD) byte; Slave to Master.
- **`Address`** and **`command`** bytes are reflected (echo) as in the master request.
- **`Byte count`** is **`0x0A`** which represents that the **total number of bytes in `Status (2-bytes) + DATA` is 10**.

> This specific HART device supports only **Device status (bytes 0-5) and Operational modes (bytes 6-7)**, thus the byte count in response message is 10 (2+8) instead of 27 (2+25)```

[Fig.4: Command 48 (Read Additional Device Status)]

  **Data bytes Interpretation:**
  
- **`00 00 08 00 02 00`** represents `byte 0-5` which is the device specific status defined by HART protocol.
- **`03 67`** represents `byte 6-7` which is Operational modes supported by the hardware.
