# HART Request-Response Examples

**HART Telegram Format**

## 1. READ Operations

### 1.1 Example 1: `(Command-0)`

Master will send `command 0` to slave and read the response data. All the bytes sections are color coded. In the above picture, **`m`** stands for master command frame **(Request)**, **`s`** stand for slave command frame **(Response)**. 

**Master Request:**
- **`03 32 36 02`** includes the **Slave address** with which the master wants to communicate with.
- **`0`** marked in RED is the command code which in this case is the **`Read Unique Identifier`**
- **`Byte Count`** is **0** in master request packet since no data is sent along with the command.

[Fig.2: Command 0 (Request & Response)]

**Slave Response**

- **`Address`** and **`command`** bytes are reflected (echo) as in the master request.
- **`Byte count`** is **`0x0E`** which represents that the **total number of bytes in `Status + DATA` is 14**.

  **Data bytes Interpretation:**
  
- **`FE`** represents `byte 0` which is static 254 by command specification.
- **`13`** represents `byte 1` which is the manufacturer ID.
- **`03`** represents `byte 2` which is manufacturer device type ID.
- **`05`** represents `byte 3` which is the number of preambles.
- **`05`** represents `byte 4` which is Universal HART command revision 5.
- **`01`** represents `byte 5` which is Device specific HART command revision number.
- **`05`** represents `byte 6` which is the software revision number.
- **`08`** represents `byte 7` which is the hardware revision number.
- **`00`** represents `byte 8` which is Device function flags, .
- **`32 36 02`** represents `bytes 9 to 11` which is the device ID of the slave.

### 1.2 Example 2: `(Command-3)`

Unit Codes of variables like temp., pressure, current etc. is specified by the HART foundation & are universalk for all HART compliant devices. For example, **`0x27`** unit code represents current in **mA**

**Master Request:**
- **`03 32 36 02`** includes the **Slave address** with which the master wants to communicate with.
- **`3`** marked in RED is the command code which in this case is the **`Read Unique Identifier`**
- **`Byte Count`** is **0** in master request packet since no data is sent along with the command.

[Fig.3: Command 3 (Read current & 4 variables)]

**Slave Response**

- **`Address`** and **`command`** bytes are reflected (echo) as in the master request.
- **`Byte count`** is **`0x1A`** which represents that the **total number of bytes in `Status + DATA` is 26**.

  **Data bytes Interpretation:**
  
- **`40 80 60 00`** represents `byte 0-3` which is the current (mA) measurement value in Floating point.
- **`27`** represents `byte 4` which is the unit (mA) of primary variable (PV), in this case, current.
- **`40 80 60 00`** represents `byte 5-8` which is redundant & indicates the value of the **Primary Variable** (PV).
- **`39`** represents `byte 9` which is unit (psi, bar, cm3/s etc) of Secondary Variable. (SV)
- **`C1 B7 E0 00`** represents `byte 10-13` which is the value of the **Secondary Variable** (SV).
- **`06`** represents `byte 14` which is unit (psi, bar, cm3/s etc) of Tertiary Variable (TV).
- **`C2 DC 80 00`** represents `byte 15-18` which is the value of the **Tertiary Variable** (TV).
- **`39`** represents `byte 19` which is unit (psi, bar, cm3/s etc) of Quarternary Variable (QV).
- **`BD 7A 00 00`** represents `byte 5-8` which is the value of the **Quarternary Variable** (QV).

### 1.3 Example 3: `(Command-33)`

This is a **Common Practice command** & may or may not be supported by all HART devices.
